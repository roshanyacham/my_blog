## Components Structure
- **BlogPost**: Displays individual blog post content.
- **BlogList**: Container for rendering a list of blog posts.
- **Header**: Displays site title and navigation links.

## Styling Approach
Used CSS Modules to scope styles to components and avoid conflicts. This approach makes the component styling modular and maintainable.

## New Features
- Blog post display with title, author, date, and content.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
- Dark mode support (optional, can be implemented with a toggle in CSS).

### Assignment Summaries

**Assignment 3**  
Assignment 3 remains unchanged from Assignment 2.

**Assignment 4**  
After adding all required files and updating `BlogList.jsx`, the page displays as blank.

**Assignment 5**  
After adding and updating all specified files, the page shows as blank.

**Assignment 6**  
All required hook files have been successfully created.

**Assignment 7**  
All necessary context files have been successfully created.

**Assignment 8**  
All specified files have been created, and the required modules have been imported.

**Assignment 9**  
An import resolution error occurs when attempting to use the `ErrorBoundary` component in `App.jsx`. The Vite development server reports that it cannot locate the component, leading to a failure in compiling and running the application.

This issue suggests that Vite cannot resolve the `ErrorBoundary` component at the specified path in `App.jsx`. Possible causes include an incorrect path, a missing file extension, a case sensitivity mismatch, or caching issues in Vite.
