## Components Structure
- **BlogPost**: Displays individual blog post content.
- **BlogList**: Container for rendering a list of blog posts.
- **Header**: Displays site title and navigation links.

## Styling Approach
Used CSS Modules to scope styles to components and avoid conflicts. This approach makes the component styling modular and maintainable.

## New Features
